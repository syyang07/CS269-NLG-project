## Introduction
In this work, we apply the LSTM model to the review generation task.
* The input is the concatenation of contexts, separator and reviews with the format as follows,
```
[Context] <SEP> [Review]
```

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7. The required packages are as follows:
* pandas
* numpy
* keras

## How to run
- Firstly, change the current working directory to LSTM/
- Please refer to the jupyter notebook for detailed instructions.
- Alternate the paths of input files in the notebook based on demands.
