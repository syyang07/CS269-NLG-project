## Introduction
In this work, we apply NMT which improves the generation process by defining a context for the each generated fake review.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7. The required packages are as follows:
* ?
* ?
* ?


## How to run
- Firstly, change the current working directory to NMT/
```
cd NMT/
```
- Example command
```
python Item-CF_user_entropies.py --train_path underexpose_train/ --test_path underexpose_test/
```
